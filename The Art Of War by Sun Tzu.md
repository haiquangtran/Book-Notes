## Attack by Stratagem
- The best thing of all is to take the enemies country whole and intact, not shattered and destroyed
- You don't want to fight and conquer all your battles, supreme excellence is breaking the enemies resistance without fighting
	- Best thing is to Balk the enemy's plans (Best to worst in order)
	- Next best is to prevent junction of the enemy's forces
	- Attack enemy in the field
	- Worst of all is to beseige walled cities
		- Doing this takes long time (6 months) and usually 3 men die for every enemy killed while the city has still not been taken.
- **Skillful leader**
  - Subdues troops without fighting
  - Captures cities without siege
  - Overthrows kingdom without lengthy operations in the field
  - Disputes the mastery of the Empire, and wihtout losing a man, his triumph will be complete
  - This is the method of attacking by Stratagem.
- **Five essentials for victory**
  - He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight
  - He will win who knows how to handle superior and inferior forces
  - He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit thoughout all its ranks
  - He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared
  - He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign
- **"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not he enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat, If you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle."**
