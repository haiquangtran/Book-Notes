# The Art Of War by Sun Tzu

## The five heads that should be familiar to every general
### He who knows them will be victorious, he who does not, will not.
- **The Moral Law**
	- Causes people to follow the leader regardless of their lives
- **Heaven**

- **Earth**
   - Comprises distances, great and small, danger and security, open ground and narrow passes, the chances of life and death
- **The Commander**

   - Marshalling of the army and the sub divisions
   - The graduations of rank among officers
   - The maintenance of roads which supplies may reach the army.

## Attack by Stratagem
- The best thing of all is to take the enemies country whole and intact, not shattered and destroyed
- You don't want to fight and conquer all your battles, supreme excellence is breaking the enemies resistance without fighting
	- Best thing is to Balk the enemy's plans (Best to worst in order)
	- Next best is to prevent junction of the enemy's forces
	- Attack enemy in the field
	- Worst of all is to beseige walled cities
		- Doing this takes long time (6 months) and usually 3 men die for every enemy killed while the city has still not been taken.
- **Skillful leader**
  - Subdues troops without fighting
  - Captures cities without siege
  - Overthrows kingdom without lengthy operations in the field
  - Disputes the mastery of the Empire, and wihtout losing a man, his triumph will be complete
  - This is the method of attacking by Stratagem.
- **Five essentials for victory**
  - He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight
  - He will win who knows how to handle superior and inferior forces
  - He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit thoughout all its ranks
  - He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared
  - He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign
- **"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat, If you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle."**

## Tactic Dispositions
- To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity to defeat the enemy lies in the enemy themselves.
- A good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy
- A clever fighter wins his battles by making no mistakes, making no mistakes establishes certainty conquering an enemy that has already been defeated
- The Victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, wherehas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.

## There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general:
- (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction;
- (2) cowardice, which leads to capture;
- (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;
- (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame;
- (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble. 

## In your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this way:
- which of the two generals has the most ability?
- on which side is Discipline most rigorously enforced?
- which army is stronger?
- on which side are the officers and men more highly trained?
- in which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment?

## Quotes
- "Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win"

- "Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical."
- "Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him."
- "The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim."
- "Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted..."
- "If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are."
- "The good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy."
- "The natural formation of the country is the soldierâ€™s best ally"

## Lessons
- 1. Only enter battles you know you can win
- 2. All warfare is based on deception
- 3. Lead your team as if you were leading a single man by the hand
- 4. Know your enemy and yourself. "The good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the enemy." Focus on things you can control, i.e. strengthening your weakness. 
- 5. Only advance if the terrain and environment is advantageous. i.e. this could be changing environments to suit your goals, or surrounding yourself around like-minded individuals.
